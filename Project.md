## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for deploying a simple Machine Learning (ML) model that predicts software engineers' salaries based on their years of experience. The model will be deployed using Streamlit, and DevOps best practices will be followed for containerization, CI/CD, and cloud deployment.

## This project doc is all about the integration of Machine Learning model simple into a best known Devops tool that together converts as an MLOPS thing
