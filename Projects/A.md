# Automated Model Performance Degradation Detection

### Problem Statement
Continuous monitoring of model performance in production to detect concept drift and data drift automatically.

### Technical Considerations
1. Statistical tests for drift detection (KS test, PSI)
2. Window-based vs. point-in-time detection approaches
3. Threshold optimization for alerting
4. Feature importance monitoring
5. Model-agnostic vs. model-specific detection
6. Computational efficiency constraints
7. False positive/negative tradeoffs
8. Integration with existing monitoring systems
9. Alert fatigue mitigation strategies
10. Automated root cause analysis integration

### Stakeholders
Data Scientists, ML Engineers, Business Analysts

### Implementation Requirements
1. Scalable data pipeline integration
2. Multi-cloud deployment support
3. Customizable alert channels
4. Historical performance baselining
5. Model version correlation
6. Business impact estimation
7. Team-specific notification rules
8. Automated documentation generation
9. Regulatory compliance tracking
10. Cost optimization considerations

### Current Challenges
