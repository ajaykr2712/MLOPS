# Automated Model Performance Degradation Detection

### Problem Statement
Continuous monitoring of model performance in production to detect concept drift and data drift automatically.

### Stakeholders
Data Scientists, ML Engineers, Business Analysts

### Current Challenges
Manual monitoring is time-consuming and reactive. No reliable automated solutions exist that work across all model types.

### Potential Solution
Develop a framework that automatically detects performance degradation using statistical tests and triggers retraining.
