# Multi-Model Deployment Orchestration

### Problem Statement
Managing deployment of hundreds of models with different frameworks and dependencies in production.

### Stakeholders
ML Engineers, DevOps Teams, Product Managers

### Current Challenges
Current solutions don't scale well and lack proper version control and rollback capabilities.

### Technical Considerations
1. Containerization strategies for model isolation
2. Dependency conflict resolution approaches
3. Performance benchmarking methodologies
4. Multi-cloud deployment patterns
5. Canary release strategies
6. Blue-green deployment implementations
7. Auto-scaling considerations
8. Health check mechanisms
9. Traffic routing algorithms
10. Failure recovery procedures

### Potential Solution
Create a unified deployment system that handles dependency isolation, versioning, and canary deployments.

### Implementation Requirements
1. Model packaging standards
2. Deployment manifest specifications
3. Version control integration
4. Rollback mechanisms
5. Performance monitoring
6. Resource utilization tracking
7. Security controls
8. Audit logging
9. API design considerations
10. User permission models
