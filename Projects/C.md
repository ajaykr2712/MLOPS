# Real-Time Feature Store for Streaming Data

### Problem Statement
Providing consistent feature computation across batch and streaming pipelines for real-time ML.

### Stakeholders
Data Engineers, ML Engineers, Data Scientists

### Current Challenges
Feature stores don't handle streaming data well, leading to training-serving skew.

### Technical Considerations
1. Exactly-once processing semantics
2. Event time vs processing time handling
3. Backpressure handling mechanisms
4. State management strategies
5. Schema evolution support
6. Late data handling
7. Watermark generation techniques
8. Checkpointing implementations
9. Fault tolerance approaches
10. Performance optimization techniques

### Potential Solution
Develop a feature store that unifies batch and streaming feature computation with exactly-once semantics.

### Implementation Requirements
1. Unified API for batch/streaming
2. Time travel capabilities
3. Point-in-time correctness
4. Metadata management
5. Data quality monitoring
6. Access control mechanisms
7. Performance benchmarking
8. Integration with ML frameworks
9. Monitoring dashboards
10. Alerting systems
